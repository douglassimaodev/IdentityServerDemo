# IdentityServerDemo
Demo of how to user Blazor web assembly with Identity server isolated (default from VS creates client and server all in the same solution)

ASP.Net 3.1

dotnet new -i identityserver4.templates

dotnet new -i Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Templates::3.2.0-rc1.20223.4

Later on I will add a webapi to be consummed from blazor client using the token from IS4Security project
